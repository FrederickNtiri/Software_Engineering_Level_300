Questions
1. What is a software process model and why is it important in software development?
Ans:A software process model is a simplified representation of a software process, it is important because Each model represents a process from a specific perspective.

2. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile software process models. 
What are the key differences between the two models and 
what are the benefits and drawbacks of each?
Agile performs testing concurrently with software development, whereas in Waterfall methodology, testing comes after the “Build” phase.
Agile allows changes in project development requirements, whereas Waterfall has no scope of changing the requirements once the project development starts.

3. What is Rational Unified Process (RUP), and 
how does it differ from other software development process models? 
What are the key phases and activities involved in RUP, and 
what are the benefits and drawbacks of using this approach in software development projects?

The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is an iterative software development process framework created by the Rational Software Corporation, a division of IBM since 2003.

The Unified Process is a generic name for a family of process models that meet a number of criteria, such as being iterative and incremental, driven by use cases, and focus on addressing risks early. It defines four project phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition.

The key phases involve in RUP are: modelling, analysis and design, implementation, testing and application.
 highly beneficial for collaborative projects, it enhancing risk management practices and improve risk management and troubleshooting efforts. it also
giving regular feedback to stakeholders.
